# Dylan's Tic Tac Toe Project

The task was to create a tic tac toe web page that satisfied the following requirements and stretch goals. 
Lines with strikethrough were not met. 

## Initial Goals
* Render a game in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* Visually display which side won or show a draw if neither player wins
* Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup (as much as possible) for HTML and CSS

## Stretch Goals

* Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
* Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
* Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations
* Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh
* Implement a reset button that resets the game without refreshing the whole page
* ~~Involve Audio in your game~~
* Add a simple AI to support one player vs computer mode. In this case, "simple" just means having the computer pick a random empty square.
* Implement a turn timer so that if a player takes too long without making a move, a random move is made for them
* Support custom board sizes: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board



### HOW TO USE 

Go to : https://dyldyl123.github.io/tictactoe/

Click on the side bar to open up additonal settings

   * AIMode -  resets the game and enables player 2 to be played by the computer
   * TimedMode - rests the game and forces players to move within 20 seconds otherwise the move is played for them
   * Grid Size Slider - Increase / Decrease the size of the game board. This modifies how many of the same tile needs to be in a row to win
   * Load up images to modify the sliders for the relevant player
   * Also includes swapping tiles as a move!
